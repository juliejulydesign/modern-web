  <p>The Keukenhof features a variety of different gardens and garden styles. For example, the English landscape garden    
  features winding paths and unexpected see-through points (designed by Zocher in 1830, the garden architect of the Vondelpark 
  in Amsterdam, among others). The historical garden is an enclosed garden where you can see many old types of bulbs. The 
  nature garden consists of a water garden where shrubs and perennials are combined with bulbous plants. The Japanese country 
  garden is a non-traditional garden in a natural environment.</p>

  <p>The Keukenhof doesn't contain the long fields of tulips many visitors expect. However, there are tulip fields outside the 
  Garden (mostly privately owned). These fields may have restricted access and are not included as part of the Keukenhof 
  ticket.</p>
