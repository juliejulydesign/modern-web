  <p><h1>History</h1></p>
  
  <p>In the 19th century, the Baron and Baroness Van Pallandt assigned the landscape architect Jan David Zocher and his son 
  Louis Paul Zocher, who had also worked on the Vondelpark, to design the grounds around the castle.</p>

  <p>The garden was established in 1949 by the then-mayor of Lisse. The idea was to present a flower exhibit where growers 
  from all over the Netherlands and Europe could show off their hybrids â€“ and help the Dutch export industry. <strong>The 
  Netherlands is the world's largest exporter of flowers.</strong></p>
