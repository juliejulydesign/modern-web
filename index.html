  <p><h1>Keukenhof Gardens</h1></p>
  
  <p>Keukenhof is situated on 15th-century hunting grounds. It was also a source of herbs for Jacqueline, Countess of     
  Hainaut's castle, which is the source of the name Keukenhof (it served to provide herbs for the castle's kitchen). Rich 
  merchants took over the grounds after the Countess's death. VOC captain and governor Adriaen Maertensz Block lived there in 
  his retirement years in the 17th century in the country house (now known as Castle Keukenhof) which he had let built in
  1641.</p>

  <p>In the 19th century, the Baron and Baroness Van Pallandt assigned the landscape architect Jan David Zocher and his son 
  Louis Paul Zocher, who had also worked on the Vondelpark, to design the grounds around the castle.</p>

  <p>The garden was established in 1949 by the then-mayor of Lisse. The idea was to present a flower exhibit where growers 
  from all over the Netherlands and Europe could show off their hybrids â€“ and help the Dutch export industry (the Netherlands   is the world's largest exporter of flowers).</p>
